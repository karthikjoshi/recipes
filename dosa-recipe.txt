Take 2 cups of idly rice. Soak it overnight in enough water. Grind it to a fine batter next day morning. Put 1 cup of grated coconut to the grinder. 
Once the mixture becomes a fine paste, stop grinding. Make a thick batter and pour it on hot griddle. Toss it around once done with generous amounts of clarified butter. 
Eat this with groundnut chutney
